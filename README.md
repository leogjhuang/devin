# Abstract

As digital platforms continue to evolve, deceptive design practices, commonly known as dark patterns, are becoming increasingly prevalent. These design choices manipulate users into taking actions they may not intend, such as sharing data, subscribing to services, or making unintended purchases. Despite growing awareness, few tools exist to help everyday users recognize and avoid these harmful design tactics.

Our project, Patch, addresses this gap by developing an AI-driven browser extension that detects and flags dark patterns in real time. Beyond simply warning users, Patch dynamically analyzes webpage structures and modifies deceptive interfaces into more transparent and user-friendly alternatives within the HTML. These changes are immediately noticeable and actionable, helping users make more informed choices.

For manipulative behaviors that occur on the server side or in data flows not visible in the page source, Patch leverages AI models trained on historical patterns to infer and flag potential dark patterns. By drawing on these learned behaviors, the system alerts users to likely manipulative tendencies even when direct modification is not possible.

Through this hybrid approach, Patch delivers both preventive and educational value. It enables users to recognize deceptive practices, promotes safer browsing, and strengthens user confidence online. We will evaluate its effectiveness through detection accuracy, user feedback, and improvements in user trust. Ultimately, Patch aims to reduce the influence of dark patterns and empower users with AI-enhanced tools that restore clarity and fairness to the digital experience.
